ðŸ“Œ Wireless Notice Board â€“ Arduino + Bluetooth + P10 LED Panel

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

A wireless digital notice board that allows sending messages via Bluetooth to an Arduino, which then displays the message on a P10 LED panel.

Eliminates the need for wired notice boards.

Useful for schools, colleges, offices, bus stations, and public places.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Wireless communication using HC-05 Bluetooth module.

P10 LED panel for bright and clear message display.

User-friendly mobile app for message sending.

Low-cost and easy-to-implement solution.

Portable and can be powered by adapter or battery.

ðŸ”¹ Hardware Used

Arduino Uno / Mega

P10 LED Display Panel

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

Power Supply (5V)

Jumper Wires

ðŸ”¹ Software Used

Arduino IDE (for programming)

Mobile Bluetooth Terminal App (to send messages)

ðŸ”¹ Working Principle

User types a message on the mobile app.

Message is sent via Bluetooth (HC-05).

Arduino receives the message.

Arduino processes the string and displays it on the P10 LED panel.

ðŸ”¹ Circuit Diagram / Connections

HC-05 â†’ Arduino TX/RX pins

P10 Module â†’ Arduino Digital Pins (with proper library support)

Power â†’ 5V regulated supply
